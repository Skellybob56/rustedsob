# What's this?
A fork of the popular GLQuake descendant [ironwail](https://github.com/andrei-drexler/ironwail) edited as the engine for a currently unnamed future project of mine.

## Planned changes (in order of probability)
- Movement changes including autohop and slope fixes for smooth stairs
- Removal of Quake-specific code
- UI overhaul
- Changed settings
- Cutscene code
